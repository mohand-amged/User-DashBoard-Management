# User Management System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the user management system with the requested fields: **name**, **salary**, **job title**, and **salary status** (whether the user receives a salary or not).

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. User Data Structure
**New Fields Added:**
- `jobTitle: string` - The user's job position
- `salary: number` - Annual salary amount in USD
- `hasSalary: boolean` - Whether the user receives a salary

### 2. User Form (Add/Edit Users)
**Location:** `src/components/features/UserForm.tsx`

**New Form Fields:**
- **Job Title**: Required text input for the user's position
- **Salary Status**: Checkbox to indicate if user receives salary
- **Annual Salary**: Number input (only visible when salary status is checked)
  - Validation: Required when salary status is enabled, minimum value of 0
  - Format: USD with thousands separator

**Form Validation:**
- Job title is required
- Salary is required only when "has salary" is checked
- Salary must be a positive number

### 3. Users Table Display
**Location:** `src/pages/Users.tsx`

**New Columns:**
- **Job Title**: Displays the user's job position
- **Salary**: Shows formatted salary ($XX,XXX) or "No salary" if not applicable
  - Includes "Salaried" indicator for users who receive salary
- **Export Support**: CSV export includes all new fields

**Table Features:**
- Sortable columns for job title and salary
- Proper formatting for salary display
- Status indicators for salaried employees

### 4. Dashboard Statistics
**Location:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**New Statistics Cards:**
- **Salaried Users**: Count of users who receive salary with percentage
- **Average Salary**: Calculated average salary for salaried employees
- **Visual Icons**: Dollar sign and trending icons for salary-related stats

**Calculations:**
- Total salaried users count
- Percentage of salaried users
- Average salary calculation (excluding non-salaried users)

### 5. API Integration
**Location:** `src/services/api.ts`

**Enhanced API Service:**
- **User Creation**: Supports new employment fields
- **User Updates**: Handles salary and job title modifications
- **Data Generation**: Automatically generates realistic job titles and salaries for demo data
- **Field Preservation**: Maintains new fields through all CRUD operations

**Generated Demo Data:**
- Random job titles from 12 professional roles
- Salaries ranging from $30,000 to $180,000
- 80% of users have salary by default

### 6. Type Safety
**Location:** `src/types/user.ts`

**Updated Interfaces:**
- `User` interface includes new employment fields
- `UserFormData` interface supports form validation
- Full TypeScript support for all new features

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/types/user.ts` - Added new field types
- `src/services/api.ts` - Enhanced API with employment data
- `src/components/features/UserForm.tsx` - Added employment form fields
- `src/pages/Users.tsx` - Added table columns and export support
